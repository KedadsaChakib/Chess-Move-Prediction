# Chess Move Prediction with CNN

This repository contains a project focused on predicting chess moves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to suggest possible next moves based on the current state of the chessboard.

## Overview

Chess Move Prediction with CNN explores the use of CNNs to analyze and predict chess moves in games. The model takes into account the current board configuration and suggests potential legal moves, aiming to assist in decision-making during chess games.
